tldr: Interesting plot, quite modern in its take of how much social media dictates our view of the world. No field remains untouched, not even writing. The writing is cheeky, making me laugh softly at all the DEI references, with no subtle takes on how most efforts ended up validating stereotypes while advocating for no biases. It's not the best thriller to any measure but it has its moments and I would definitely recommend it for a fun read.

## The Backdrop

June Hayward is an accidental witness to the death of her only friend Athena, the acclaimed author. She is a struggling author herself in a climate where publishing houses seem to be looking for a "diverse" niche to promote their writers. In a moment of bad judgement — she decides to publish Athena's manuscript on the struggle of Chinese laborers under the misleading name, Juniper Song. Needless to say, her deal with the devil catches up with her.

## The Good

**Writing** — The writing has its moments for sure. The sense of death of society as we know it that stays dormant inside me all the time came out in its full form seeing how June gets trolled. Her musings, the way she protects herself, her constant justification of her wrongdoings. Writing fairly unlikeable human characters without making them seem caricaturish is difficult and I think the book managed to get it right.

**Plot buildup** — I liked that the plot was very focused. There were no patronizing bits, no spoonfeeding — just a crisp, interesting, fast paced narrative.

**Cultural sensitivity** — Writing this review in 2026 when the cultural narrative seemed to have swapped to 180 from when this book was written — I appreciate the nuances when the book talks about how her Chinese readers felt when they read June's book. The seminar chapter, where June faces questions from Chinese readers, is one of the more thoughtful moments in the book. It highlights how deeply diaspora communities rely on stories to preserve culture — and why misrepresentation hurts more than outsiders realize.

## The Not-So-Good

**The ending** — I found it to be a bit anti-climactic. I didn't think it was a bad ending, just maybe a bit not deserving of the kind of build up to it.

**Athena** — By the end I was definitely a bit under-connected to her character. I wish there was a bit more about her connection with her mother or to June. Athena remaining underdeveloped undercut the emotional stakes of the plagiarism for me.
