The character building let the plot down and unfortunately, as happens with one too many books of this thriller genre, the reveal felt wholly unsatisfying, leaving me with a sour taste for what could&#39;ve been a richer, more well thought out story. </p> </div> </div> <h2 style="margin-top: 42px;">Notes</h2> <div class="card"> <article> <h2 id="the-backdrop">The Backdrop</h2>
<p>The story revolves around an amateur author Lowen who lands a hefty contract to complete an unfinished series of books by renowned author Verity who suffered an accident which left her in a semi-vegetative state. She is offered by Verity’s husband Jeremy Crawford to live at their house so she could analyze her notes. She finds an unpublished autobiography she falls upon in Verity’s study, detailing how she was madly obsessed with her husband. The drama unfolds as she starts falling for Jeremy with Verity’s eyes following her silently as she gets closer to him.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p><strong>The setup: 4.5/5</strong> — From the get go, the story captures our attention because of its detailed disturbing descriptions of postpartum depression and the extent to which a sick psychopathic mother could go to get what she wants. I was invested in little Crew, their son and found myself fearing for his life very often while reading the book.</p>
<p><strong>The children and Dad</strong> — I found the bits with the children to be well written and relatable, whether it was the diner where Crew was joking with Jeremy and Lowen or the chapters of Harper and Chastin. Their relationship with their father, the way he worries about them, and the emotional effects of their deaths was poignant and touching.</p>
<p><strong>The pace</strong> — The book kept me hooked till the end - I never once considered putting it down.</p>
<h2 id="the-not-so-good">The Not-So-Good</h2>
<p><strong>The writing</strong> — This is the first book I have read by this author. I felt the writing was very mediocre. Lowens’ character lacked the depth of real human emotions, with each back story (her mother, Corey) feeling more like just a checkbox than adding any real layers or human elements to her.</p>
<p><strong>Lowen</strong> — It was very very hard to invest in the character of a 32 year old author who behaved like a 17 year old hormonal teenager at every step in the book. It was hard to believe an author would not finish reading a book written by the woman she was so afraid of and would stretch it over multiple days. I found her character to be wholly hard to care for or invest in. The only parts where I felt she was okay were again, her interactions with Crew. I understand of course that not all characters are meant to be likeable but even for what she was described as, her actions seemed contradictory at way too many points.</p>
<p><strong>The love story</strong> — Jeremy and Lowen felt too much like teenagers dressed like adults. There was a depth missing in both their characters and maybe because of that, their love story seemed very forced and childish.</p> </article> </div>  </div> </body></html>
