One of the best ones I read in 2025, it hit all the right notes - emotional, dramatic, thrilling and oh what fun to read. Manako Kaji, a prisoner suspected to have murdered three of her lovers, had me at hello. Rika Machado, the protagonist, a journalist hell-bent on getting out the facts, felt very relatable. It was such a delight flipping through the pages, experiencing the journey with her, all to a very satisfying, scrumptious conclusion. </p> </div> <article style="grid-column: 1 / -1; border-top: 1px solid var(--border); margin-top: 10px; padding-top: 10px;"> <p>Personally, I have found fiction to influence my life far more than any self-help book. Butter is one of those rare novels that really changed my outlook toward food — and maybe a bit more than that. Disguised as an easy read, this book connected with me in a way I hadn’t expected at all.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p><strong>The characters</strong> — Asako takes her time with each character. Her characters are flesh and bones, I felt I knew them and found myself anticipating how they would behave as the plot progressed. Whether it was Rika, the ambitious journalist; Reiko, her best friend, having her back at every point; Shinoi, her confidante — every character feels deeply personal. And of course, the central character Manako Kaji, a layered complex woman representing freedom and submission at once.</p>
<p><strong>The central conflict</strong> — Manako Kaji is extremely selfish — she pleases others by pleasing herself, she doesn’t treat her body and soul as a trash can. Rika is how we all seem to be these days, immersed in her job with no time for our friends and family. Even then, it is Manako in prison. So what is the answer? How and when are we truly happy? Maybe today, in the age of the loneliness epidemic and diminishing work-life balance, it is more relevant than ever to question why we do what we do and why we accept what we accept.</p>
<p><strong>The action</strong> — The book is very well paced. The action felt real, I could feel my heart beating faster when Reiko was in trouble. I could feel the rush when Rika was finally freed from her obsession of Manako. The book never felt boring and I believe for a book with that much to say, it is a feat to keep it crisp.</p>
<p><strong>Literally everything</strong> — I cannot recommend this book enough, especially to women like me in our 30s. You will find someone you can relate with, you will enjoy some of the dialogue and oh my will you crave a hot Japanese meal.</p>
<h2 id="the-not-so-good">The Not-So-Good</h2>
<p><strong>I could not relate with some of the imagery</strong> — There was a repeated reference to the story of a group of tigers churning milk that felt lost on me — likely due to cultural context I wasn’t familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>I would have liked to know more</strong> — When the book ended, I felt a bit like I had lost some friends.</p> </article> </div>  </div> </body></html>
